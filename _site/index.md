## About Me

Hi I'm James Goodman, I'm an enthusiastic and driven graduate developer with in-depth knowledge attaining to the core principles of programming both well documented and reusable code, in Object Orientated languages.

As an avid gamers and games dev enthusiast I enjoys the challenge of attempting to replicate features and systems present in other games, as well as experimenting with new ones that I can implement in my own projects.

I'm always eager to learn new skills and techniques that I can use to further improve my programming abilities after having completed my undergraduate degree in *Computer Science with Game Development* at the *University of Sussex*.

The degree featured a range of modules that taught me the core techniques and data structures used in everyday programming, as well as creative modules like 3D Animation and Video Production Techniques that allowed for more creative freedom and experimentation with modeling and editing software.

## Overview

This website provides details about the majority of the  the projects I have completed both as a hobby and for my degree. Here you can see the projects in action without the need to download, clone, install, unzip or even understand what the code does under the hood.

Each project's page features a short description about its purpose as well as videos and screenshots of the software in action.

However should you want to try out or mess around with any of the projects, information is provided with steps on how to get each up and running respectively.

### Browse

A list of all projects can be found on the "Browse Projects" tab. Projects are divided into sub-catagories based on origin or purpose.
