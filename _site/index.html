<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>Hi I’m James Goodman, I’m an enthusiastic and driven software developer with a passion for coding, making games or doing basically anything involving computers. Thanks to my degree and many years of tinkering, trial, error and stack overflow I’ve developed an in-depth knowledge attaining to the core principles of programming both well documented and reusable code, in Object Orientated languages.</p>

<p>As an avid gamer and games dev enthusiast I enjoy the challenge of attempting to replicate features and systems present in other games, as well as experimenting with new ones that I can implement in my own projects.</p>

<p>I’m always eager to learn new skills and techniques that I can use to further improve my programming abilities after having completed my undergraduate degree in <em>Computer Science with Game Development</em> at the <em>University of Sussex</em> with the result of a <em>2:1</em>.</p>

<p>The degree gave me a solid foundation of understanding for the core techniques and data structures used in everyday programming, as well as some more creative modules like 3D Animation/Modelling and Video Production that allowed for a bit more freedom and experimentation with asset creation, as well as giving me a great insight into the intertwined workflows of Design, Art and Programming and how, by their powers combined you get a enjoyable experience.</p>

<h3 id="my-cv">My CV</h3>

<p>Here you can view my CV which contains information regarding both my education and previous experience.</p>

<p>A PDF of the CV is available by right-clicking the link above and selecting “Save link as…”.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This website provides details about the majority of the projects I have completed both personally and for my degree. Here you can see the projects in action without the need to download, clone, install, unzip or even understand what the code does under the hood.</p>

<p>Each project’s page features a short description about its purpose as well as videos and screenshots of the software in action.</p>

<p>However should you want to try out or mess around with any of the projects links to the repositories are provided.</p>

<h2 id="letter-chain">Letter Chain</h2>

<p>My enthusiasm for game development has led me to broaden my skills in Unity during my free time, by creating an android app called “Letter Chain”, which I have since released to the play store. This involved using Unity Services to set up Ad Monetization and fulfilling the various requirements of releasing an app using the Google Play Console.</p>

<h2 id="3d-modeling">3D Modeling</h2>

<p>In my spare time I also like to create 3D assets for use in both my personal projects and for 3D printing. These range of a variety of models from construction equipment inspired by my job at Costain to low poly assets for blocking out a scene. It also allows me a great insight into the workflows of artists and designers and how it meshes with development. The page below contains examples of some of my work.</p>
