<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>The majority of my projects fall under one of the following three categories. Games are, as the name would suggest, video games that are primarily built using the Unity3D engine and programmed in C#. The collection contains a variety of game genres from space shooters to table top recreations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Games
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/pages/games/heroes_quest/heroes_quest.html">Heroes Quest</a></li>
      <li><a href="/pages/games/letter_chain/letter_chain.html">Letter Chain</a></li>
      <li><a href="/pages/games/stellar_strategy/stellar_strategy.html">Stellar Strategy</a></li>
      <li><a href="/pages/games/ship_smash/ship_smash.html">Ship Smash</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tools are projects that were created with a specific purpose or goal in mind. This ranges from either using that project to explore a new library or data structure to creating an application that solves a problem faced by users, for example screen ‘real estate’ on a single monitor.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tools
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/pages/tools/rail_network_simulator/rail_network_simulator.html">Rail Network Simulator</a></li>
      <li><a href="/pages/tools/pip_player/pip_player.html">“Play In Picture” Player</a></li>
      <li><a href="/pages/tools/raytrace_engine/raytrace_engine.html">Raytrace Rendering Engine</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally coursework projects are those that I was tasked with completing for various modules of my degree. This includes both team and individual projects where I was provided with a specification and tasked with creating a program or application to fulfil that design.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coursework
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/pages/coursework/futo_puzzle/futo_puzzle.html">Futoshiki Puzzle</a></li>
      <li><a href="/pages/coursework/student_system/student_system.html">Student Management System</a></li>
      <li><a href="../coursework/stock_simulation/stock_simulation.md">Stock Exchange Simulation</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
