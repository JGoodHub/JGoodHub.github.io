<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The PIP Player rather “Play In Picture” Player is a Java application designed to combat the issue of small screen real estate. THe player is designed to take in a youtube video link and then displays it in a dedicated window. The advantage of this is that the window is coded to always render on top of the windows behind it. This means that a user can have say a programming tutorial loaded up at the same time as using an IDE in fullscreen mode.</p>

<p>Here is a video of the player being used to load up a programming video, overlaying the Netbeans IDE.</p>
