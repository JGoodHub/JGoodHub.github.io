## Overview

Rail network simulator is a tool designed to mimic the iconic style and layout of the London Underground tube map. The user is able to add stations or stops to the map and then connect those using tracks. FInally you specify which stations are on a trains routes and how go.

The simulation then runs trains along the routes you creating, showing your miniature rail system in action. The end goal for the project is to also have the simulator account for varying levels of foot traffic and different times of the day, as well as the ability to bypass some stations or wait outside others for previous trains to leave.
