<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Stellar strategy is a work in progress space-combat RTS/Real Time Strategy game. Once complete the game will allow for two players, be them human or AI to battle against one another using an wide arsenal of ships and weapons on a solar system scale map.</p>

<p>In its current state the game allows for players to select ships in their armies and move them about the map. Furthermore ships can and will fire upon enemies once they’re in range. If a ships are equip with rechargeable shields but if one takes enough damage they’re destroyed in an explosive fashion.</p>

<p>The idea and inspiration for the project came for the 2006 Star Wars RTS, Empire At War, whose space battles took a similar, albeit smaller scale approach to combat in space.</p>
