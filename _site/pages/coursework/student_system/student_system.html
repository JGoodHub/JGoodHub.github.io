<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>For the Web Applications and Services module I was tasked with creating a Student Management System that could track and aid supervisors in their role of selecting students for dissertation projects. The coursework was an exercise in our understanding of distributed systems and their roles in everyday applications.</p>

<p>The systems created allows for administrators to register new supervisors and students onto the system. Users can then login to their respective accounts but can only access pages related to their role, others are locked away behind security measures e.g. to stop a student accepting their own project proposal. From here students can propose or select from dissertation projects under various supervisors. Supervisors then have the ability to accept or reject a student who has request their project.</p>

<p>Here is a video of the coursework in action.</p>

<p>A pre-built version of the application can be found in the “dist” root directory, this contains a runnable version of the software, a .jar file, that you can use on your machine.</p>
