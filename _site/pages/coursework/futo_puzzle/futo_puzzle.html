<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The Futoshiki puzzle was one of the first programs I created in the course of my degree and is design to replicate the table-top board game of the same name. Similar to Sudoku the player is presented with a grid of tiles, some pre-filled with number based on the difficultly. Spread across the board are a range of “Rules”, these state the where the number in one tile is greater than or less than its direct neighbor. The challenge presents itself when the play has to fill in all tiles with number while still adhering to these rules. Again like Sudoku no row or colum can have the consecutive occurrences of the same number.</p>

<p>The coursework was set as part of the Further Programming module which focused on strengthening my abilities in Object Orientated languages such as Java and also UI packages such as Java Swing to make quick application prototypes.</p>

<p>A pre-built version of the application can be found in the “dist” root directory, this contains a runnable version of the software, a .jar file, that you can use on your machine.</p>
