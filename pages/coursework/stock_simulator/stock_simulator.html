		<h1>Stock Exchange Simulation (Front End)</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>

		<p>
			The stock exchange simulator was created as a team exercise for the Software Engineering module of the degree. The exercise involved creating a prototype application for a specification provided to us by the course tutor, in teams of 5 we would work to delegate tasks, hold and track team meetings and learn about different software development practices used in the industry.
		</p>

		<p>
			The specification given to our group required us to create a application that could simulate a basic stock exchange. This would involve a set of fake virtual companies along side brokers who would dynamically invest in different companies based on various factors like economic growth or a companies success/failure. All back-end simulation logic could then be set-up and observed from a front-end interface.
		</p>

		<p>
			My role for the project was to create and link the front-end interface to the back-end logic developed by the other group members. For a first draft I created basic paper prototypes to define the core elements of what needed to be displayed and roughly how much of the screen it should consume. This was then developed into a rough JavaFX interface which became the basis for the final UI present in the submission.
