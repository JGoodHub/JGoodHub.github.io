## Overview

The stock exchange simulator was created as a team exercise for the Software Engineering module of the degree. The exercise involved creating a prototype application for a specification provided to us by the course conveyer, in teams of 5 we would work to delegate tasks, hold and track team meetings and learn about different software development practices used in the industry.

The specification given to our group required us to create a application that could simulate a basic stock exchange. This would involve a set of fake virtual companies along side brokers who would dynamically invest in different companies based on various factors like economic growth or a companies success/failure. All back-end simulation logic could then be set-up and observed from a front-end interface.

My role for the project was to create and link the front-end interface to the back-end logic developed by the other group members. For a first draft I created basic paper prototypes to define the core elements of what needed to be displayed and roughly how much of the screen it should consume. This was then developed into a rough JavaFX interface which became the basis for the final UI present in the submission.

While the application as a whole was never fully functional due to time constraints a pre-built version of the UI can be found and explored from the "dist" folder in the root directory. This contains a runnable version of the software, a .jar file, that you can use on your machine.
