## About Me

Hi I'm James Goodman, I'm an enthusiastic and driven graduate developer with in-depth knowledge attaining to the core principles of programming both well documented and reusable code, in Object Orientated languages.

As an avid gamers and games dev enthusiast I enjoys the challenge of attempting to replicate features and systems present in other games, as well as experimenting with new ones that I can implement in my own projects.

I'm always eager to learn new skills and techniques that I can use to further improve my programming abilities after having completed my undergraduate degree in Games and Multimedia Environments at the University of Sussex.

The degree featured a range of modules that taught me the core techniques and data structures used in everyday programming, as well as creative modules like 3D Animation and Video Production Techniques that allowed for more creative freedom and experimentation.

## Overview

This website details all the nitty gritty details about the projects I have completed both as a hobby and for my degree. Here you can see the projects in action without the need to download, clone, install, unzip or even understand what the code does under the hood.

However should you want to try out or mess around with any of the projects, information is provided with steps on how to get it up and running.

## Projects

The majority of my projects fall under one of the following three categories. Games are, as the name would suggest, video games that are primarily built using the Unity3D engine and programmed in C#. The collection contains a variety of game genres from space shooters to table top recreations.

Tools are projects that were created with a specific purpose or goal in mind. This ranges from either using that project to explore a new library or data structure to creating an application that solves a problem faced by users, for example screen 'real estate' on a single monitor.

Finally coursework projects are those that I was tasked with completing for various modules of my degree. This includes both team and individual projects where I was provided with a specification and tasked with creating a program or application to fulfil that design.

A list of all projects can be found on the "Browse Projects" tab. Projects are divided into sub-catagories based on origin or purpose.
